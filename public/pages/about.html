    <h2>This is a simple Todo Single Page Application</h2>
    <hr>
    
    <p>The front-end is written in Angular.  The idea there is to minimize page refreshes and keep data transfers to a minumum.  Angular-route takes care of the front end application state.</p>
    
    <p>The backend is an Express app served by Node, accessing a Postgres database.  Users can register, create, edit and complete todo items from their private todo list.</p>
    
    <p>My goal in creating this was to teach myself Node, Express and Angular.  Although this app uses SQL instead of Mongo, it wouldn't me difficult to swap in a NoSQL database.</p>
